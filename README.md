# Welcome to our Riot Stats Checker Project - WP.GG

Hello and welcome to the Riot Stats Checker project! This project was born out of a week-long spring break adventure by a group of friends: Alex, Kevin, and myself, Jeevi.

## About the Project

During our break, we set out to create a tool that allows League of Legends players to easily check their in-game statistics. We initially began by developing a Python script to handle all the data fetching. However, we soon realized that our chosen platform, Firebase, didn't support Python. With quick thinking and adaptability, we seamlessly transitioned to using JavaScript for our backend needs.

## How to Use

Our Riot Stats Checker provides a simple interface for users to input their summoner name and view their stats. With just a few clicks, you can access information about your top champions, match history, and more!
